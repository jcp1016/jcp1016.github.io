In an earlier post I linked New York City 311 data with American Community Survey (ACS) statistics on poverty for the same year and created several static charts.  

As a follow-up I've created an interactive map so you can optionally isolate poverty statistics for children, the elderly, and families.

The story is especially heartbreaking when you look at the data for children.  In the poorest communities of the city, more than half of all children live below the poverty level.  Roughly a quarter of all complaints to 311 from these communities are for inadequate heating.  Other complaints that top the list reveal problems with plumbing, paint/plaster and electricity.  In other words, basic human needs.

Looking at areas where few people live in poverty, the data reveal a different class of problems like noise, broken muni meters, and taxi complaints.  Heating calls are received in these areas too, but as a much lower proportion of all complaints from the same area.
